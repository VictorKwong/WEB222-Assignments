    <h1>Favorite Place - Japanüéå</h1>

        <tr>
            <td><p>Once upon a time... I had a chance to visit in Japan with my family. Now that is my Favorite place! This is the Nara Park that I‚Äôve visit with my family. They are so friendly, but sometimes also aggressive when you have food in your hand. I had a chance to buy some of the crackers to feed the deer. In japan, there is a formal greeting gestures to bow down first. It means that you are paying respect to the strangers and elders. The more angle you bow down, the more respect you are giving to the other person. However, the deer also being taught and train the manners to the visitors. They will bow down first and you can give the food to the deer. Before that I have no idea how it works because I wasn‚Äôt knowing the tradition of the japan culture, when you have a time to visit in Japan, I think this will be the first place that I will definitely recommend! There is also a small hiking path for the visitors.</p></td>

            <td><p>Inside the Nara Park, there is a Buddha place called Todaiji Temple, I have no idea what is going on there because I‚Äôm not very interest on those place. When the family told me it was the world largest wooden building and it was constructed on ~1600 years ago, I was kinda shock that I am standing in front of the largest wooden building. WOW!!! There are also some souvenir shops nearby. I take a glimpse and want to take a picture with those fancy items, but the shop keeper said it is not permit to take pictures for their items. Hmm maybe they will sell other different items when I visit there another time.</p></td>

        <tr>
            <td><p>Of course when I am mentioning the favorite place, we should also talk about their food. One of the main fruit they are selling is grapes called Kyoho grapes. It is HUGE size and the taste is very sweet. I saw one of them selling in the supermarket so I took a picture and record it!</p></td>

            <td><img src="../img/Noodles.jpg" alt="Ramen"></td>
            <td><p>After we visit a lot of places, we felt so hungry and we went to one of the Ramen shop. I heard Japan are selling one of the best ramen in the whole world. Before I went there, I have watch some of the youtube videos to study their ingredients. I was very shock that their noodle soup needs a lot of work in order to make it taste good. The soup needs onions, leek, some secret ingredient pepper, pork bone‚Ä¶ I can‚Äôt remember all of them and I am not an expert chief, but I remember they took at least ~4 hours to make a decent soup. When I am eating I won‚Äôt see how much work the chief has put through, but they definitely professional at making the best ramen to the customers. Another point is, when you eating the ramen, you should make loud sounds to suck up the noodles. The sucking sound brings respect to the chief, saying that ‚Äúthe ramen taste very good and I am enjoying it‚Äù.</p></td>

        <tr>
            <td><p>The next stop will be the Kuromon Ichiba Market in Osaka. This place is very special to me because it sells a lot of delicious street food to the customers, they also have supermarket and selling fresh Uni and seafood meat. But My favorite street food is takoyaki, it is a ball-shaped Japanese snack that looks like chicken meat balls, but inside there is octopus meat instead of chicken. The juicy taste I can still remember. When I thinking of how it tastes, my mouth gets full of saliva. We pick up some food that can bring it back home, include chips and some fancy soft drinks.</p></td>

            <td><img src="../img/KamoRiver.jpg" alt="Kamo River"></td>
            <td><p>Kamo River is also one of my favorite place because I love enjoy the nature in Kyoto. The river there is very famous because people enjoyed playing water in the river, the children will swim there during summer time. I think it is famous because they are some history background involved with it. I remember we walk there and because I was so thirsty during the summer time. I asked my parents to brought a drink in one of the stores. The green tea is delicious. Our family enjoyed walking there to take some fresh air. When I mention this popular place there are always some souvenir shops. I also took some of the picture this time and I asked the shop keeper permission to do it. The people there are so lovely!</p></td>
